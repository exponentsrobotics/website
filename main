				The Exponents Robotics team, sponsored by <a href="http://onedayacademy.com" target="_blank"> One Day Academy</a>, 
				gives homeschooled middle schoolers and high schoolers a chance to compete in the <a href="http://best.eng.auburn.edu/" target="_blank">BEST Robotics</a> 
				competitions every fall. 
				Exponents provides a hands-on opportunity for homeschool students to experience science and engineering in a Christian atmosphere. 
				We recognize that we have a calling to a Higher Power in all we do with our lives, including both education for engineering and science vocations.
				Capitol BEST (Boosting Engineering Science and Technology) is a robotics contest which encourages students to pursue studies in science and engineering.

				<p>
				Each year, teams must design, build, and perform specific tasks with robots built from a box of raw materials. 
				On contest day, teams compete against each other to see which team has designed and built the best robot. 
				Winners advance to the Texas BEST regional competition, and then, to the national BEST competition.
				The BEST program encourages students to pursue studies and careers in engineering, science and technology and introduces
				them to some of the engineering/scientific methods through mentoring by industry professionals and hands-on experience. 
				The students experience real-world engineering in a fun sports-like robotics competition.
